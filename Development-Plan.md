# Development plan high level

## Design and finalize the backend API:

Before diving into the implementation, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the API endpoints and the data structures that will be used. You can use tools like Swagger or Postman to help you design, document, and test the API.

## Set up the development environment:

Depending on your choice of backend framework (ASP.NET Core, Flask, or Django), set up the development environment, including the necessary libraries, tools, and IDEs.

## Develop the backend API:

Start by implementing the core API endpoints and their corresponding functionalities. This includes user authentication, CRUD operations for user profiles, favorite lists, and recommendations. Make sure to test the endpoints as you develop them.

## Integrate AI services:

Once the basic API functionalities are in place, start integrating the AI services like the large language model, text-to-speech, and potentially the visual model generation. Make sure to test each integration thoroughly.

## Develop the frontend:

With a functional backend in place, start working on the frontend using Next.js. Develop the main components of the web app, such as the landing page, user registration/login, user dashboard, AI assistant chat interface, and

## Develop the frontend:

With a functional backend in place, start working on the frontend using Next.js. Develop the main components of the web app, such as the landing page, user registration/login, user dashboard, AI assistant chat interface, and the pages for browsing and managing favorite lists, recommendations, and community discussions.

## Connect the frontend with the backend:

Implement the necessary API calls from the frontend to the backend to fetch data and interact with the AI services. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback during API calls.

## Develop the React Native mobile app:

Once the web app is functional, start working on the mobile app using React Native. Reuse as much code and components as possible from the Next.js frontend while adapting the user interface and user experience for mobile devices.

## Test the entire application:

Perform thorough testing of the entire application, both on the web and mobile platforms. This includes functional, usability, and security testing. Consider involving beta testers to gather feedback and identify any issues.

## Optimize and deploy:

After addressing any issues found during testing, optimize the application for performance and deploy it to the appropriate hosting services for the web app and app stores for the mobile app.

## Post-launch support and updates:

Monitor the application's performance and user feedback after launch. Address any issues and consider adding new features based on user needs and feedback.

# Aria (AI Assistant) chat window implementation

Both WebSockets and REST APIs can work for implementing Aria's chat functionality, but each has its advantages and trade-offs. Let's compare the two approaches regarding context maintenance and overall suitability for the application:

## WebSockets:

Context maintenance: With WebSockets, a continuous connection is maintained between the client and server. This persistent connection allows you to easily associate the chat session with the AI's context. You can store the context information either on the server-side or pass it back and forth between the client and server.

Real-time interactivity: WebSockets provide low-latency communication, which is essential for real-time chat applications. Users can have more natural and responsive conversations with Aria.

Efficiency: WebSockets reduce the overhead associated with repeated HTTP requests in REST APIs. This makes them more efficient for chat applications with frequent message exchanges.

### Detailed description of how to implement the chat interface with Aria using WebSockets:

**WebSocket server**: Implement a WebSocket server on the backend, which will handle the incoming connections from clients and maintain the communication with the AI assistant API. You can use libraries like Socket.IO (Node.js), Django Channels (Python), or Action Cable (Ruby on Rails) to set up the server.

**WebSocket client**: Create a WebSocket client in the frontend application that establishes a connection with the WebSocket server. This client will send user messages to the server and receive the AI assistant's responses. You can use the native WebSocket API available in modern browsers or a library like Socket.IO-client for this purpose.

**Message handling**: Once the WebSocket connection is established, handle incoming messages from users by forwarding them to the AI assistant API. When the API returns a response, send it back to the corresponding client over the WebSocket connection.

**UI for the chat interface**: Design a user interface for the chat interface, where users can type their messages and view the AI assistant's responses. You may want to include features like message timestamps, user avatars, and typing indicators.

**Managing chat history**: Store the chat history between the user and the AI assistant in the database to allow users to access their previous conversations. You can store the chat history either in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

**Authentication and authorization**: Secure the WebSocket connection by implementing authentication and authorization. You can use a token-based approach like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users and ensure only authorized users can access the chat interface.It l

## REST API:

Context maintenance: REST APIs are stateless by design, so maintaining context requires more effort. You can store the context on the server-side and associate it with the user's session or a unique identifier. Alternatively, you can include the context in each request and response, passing it between the client and server.

Simplicity: Implementing a chat application with REST APIs is generally simpler than using WebSockets, especially if you already have a RESTful architecture in place for other parts of the application.

Scalability: REST APIs are inherently stateless, making them easier to scale horizontally. However, this advantage might be less relevant for a chat application where context and state are essential.

### High-level overview of how you can implement the chat application using a REST API:

**API endpoint**: Create a new API endpoint (e.g., POST /messages) on the server to handle incoming messages from the client.

**Message handling**: When a message is sent from the client, the server forwards it to the AI assistant API, processes the response, and returns it to the client.

**Polling or long-polling**: Since REST is stateless and doesn't maintain a continuous connection, you'll need a mechanism to check for new messages from the AI assistant. You can use polling (periodically sending requests) or long-polling (waiting for a response until there's a new message or a timeout occurs) to achieve this.

**UI for the chat interface**: Design a user interface similar to the one described for the WebSocket implementation. The main difference is that you'll send messages and fetch responses using HTTP requests instead of a WebSocket connection.

**Managing chat history**: Store the chat history in the database, as previously described.

**Authentication and authorization**: Secure the API endpoint using token-based authentication like JWT or OAuth2 to ensure only authorized users can access the chat interface.

## Conclusion:

In summary, if you prioritize real-time interactivity, efficiency, and natural conversation flow, WebSockets would be the better option for implementing Aria's chat functionality. However, if you prefer simplicity and are willing to manage context and state explicitly, a REST API-based solution might be more suitable.
