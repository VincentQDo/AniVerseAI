# Idea: AI-Powered Virtual Manga and Anime Assistant

## Name: AniVerseAI


## Description

OtakuBuddyAI is a website and mobile app that combines your interests in AI, video games, manga, anime, and web development. The platform features an AI-powered virtual manga and anime assistant, which uses large language models to interact with users, recommend content, and provide insights and trivia about their favorite manga, anime, and video games. Additionally, the AI assistant (Aria) can be integrated into a virtual avatar similar to a VTuber, like Neuro Sama.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (Web), React Native (iOS/Android App)
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Library**:
  - OpenAI GPT (Language Model)
  - Google's text-to-speech
  - Stable Diffusion (Visual Model)
  - OpenAI GPT open-source alternatives: Hugging Face's Transformers library, which provides access to various pre-trained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. You can fine-tune these models on your specific dataset to generate relevant recommendations and interactions for users.

## Features:

Users can stay informed with the latest news and updates in the manga, anime, and video game industries.


OtakuBuddyAI offers an engaging and interactive platform for users to explore their passions and connect with like-minded individuals.

# High level Implementation details

## Visual model for the AI assistant:

- **Design the character**: Sketch out a character design or create a concept art for the AI assistant, keeping in mind the aesthetics and style that appeals to manga, anime, and video game enthusiasts.

- **Generate the visual model**: Utilize AI techniques like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or Stable Diffusion to create a variety of facial expressions and poses for the assistant. You can train the model on your character design and a dataset of anime or manga-style images.

- **Animate the avatar**: Use tools like Live2D, Unity, or Unreal Engine to create animations for the virtual avatar. These tools enable you to bring the character to life by animating facial expressions, body movements, and lip-syncing with the AI-generated speech.

## Text-to-speech
Use an open-source text-to-speech library like Mozilla's TTS or Google's Text-to-Speech. These libraries allow you to convert the AI-generated text into spoken audio that can be synced with the virtual avatar.

Google's Text-to-Speech and Mozilla's TTS both provide the capability to generate more human-like speech. Google's Text-to-Speech uses Google's WaveNet deep learning model, which produces high-quality and natural-sounding speech. Mozilla's TTS also allows you to use various pre-trained voices or even train your own custom voice model to create more human-like speech output.

## Free data sources on manga, anime, and games:
- [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/): An unofficial MyAnimeList API that provides data on anime and manga.
- [IGDB API](https://www.igdb.com/api): Offers data on video games, including release dates, platforms, and more.
- [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/): Provides information on anime and manga, including airing schedules, characters, and staff.

# Features in more details

# Community Feature

The community feature would function similarly to a user forum. Here's a detailed description of the community feature's components and how they could work together:

Discussions:

Users can create discussion threads related to a specific content or a general topic.
Each thread has a title and an initial post that describes the topic.
Other users can add comments or replies to the discussion, fostering conversation and engagement.
Users can upvote, downvote, or report posts and comments.
Users can sort discussions by recency, popularity, or activity.
Content Sharing:

Users can create a post to share their favorite content (anime, manga, or game) with the community.
Each post contains information about the content, such as the title, image, and a brief description, along with the user's thoughts or recommendations.
Other users can comment on the post, ask questions, and share their experiences or opinions.
Users can upvote, downvote, or report shared content posts.
Recommendations Exchange:

Users can request recommendations based on their interests or specific criteria (e.g., genre, theme, or mood).
A recommendation request post includes the user's preferences and any additional context.
Other users can respond with their recommendations in the comments section.
Users can upvote, downvote, or report recommendations.
Navigation and usage:

The community feature has a main landing page that displays a feed of the latest and most popular posts, including discussions, content sharing, and recommendation requests.
Users can filter the feed by post type (discussion, content sharing, or recommendations) or by specific content types (anime, manga, or game).
Each post has a "tag" or "category" label, allowing users to quickly identify the type of post (e.g., "Discussion," "Content Sharing," "Recommendation Request").
Users can click on a post to view the full thread, read comments, and add their input.
Users can create a new post by clicking a "New Post" button and selecting the post type (discussion, content sharing, or recommendation request).
Users can search for specific content or keywords in the community feature using a search bar, which filters the feed based on the search query.
By creating a user-friendly interface with straightforward navigation, the community feature will encourage users to engage in discussions, share their favorite content, and exchange recommendations with fellow enthusiasts.

There might be some overlap between the AI assistant and the community feature. However, both can coexist and complement each other, providing users with multiple ways to discover and enjoy content.

To make the community feature stand out, we can integrate the AI assistant within the community discussions. Here are a few ideas to achieve this:

AI-generated recommendations within community threads: When a user posts a recommendation request, the AI assistant can be the first to respond with a few AI-generated recommendations based on the user's preferences and request context.

AI assistant moderation: The AI assistant can help moderate the community by identifying spam or inappropriate content and flagging it for review.

AI-driven insights: Users can mention the AI assistant within a discussion, and it can provide insights or data about specific content, such as average user ratings, release dates, or voice actors.

AI-curated content: The AI assistant can create weekly or monthly community posts featuring curated recommendations or trends based on user interactions and preferences.

By integrating the AI assistant into the community feature, we can create a unique experience that sets AniVerseAI apart from other forums like MyAnimeList or Reddit.

Users could have the option to upvote or downvote news articles, comment on them, and share them on social media.

# Event Calendar Feature:

The event calendar would display a list of upcoming events related to anime, manga, and gaming.
